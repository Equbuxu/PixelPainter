# PixelPainter
A custom client for 
[pixelplace.io](https://pixelplace.io/).
Supports most of the features the original website has along with some additions, such as:

- **Use multiple accounts simultaneously**

  Used to bypass painting speed limits. A single account can usually go up to ~13px/s, but with multiple accounts, you can go much faster.

- **Automatic painting**

  Tired of fixing griefed drawings? Don't want to draw manually at all? Just make a new task, select any image and the program will do the rest for you!

- **Various custom brushes**

  The default 1x1 brush is lame. This client has an adjustable brush size (Up to 25x25!) and a history brush that lets you fix your drawings with little effort.

- **Premium user tracker**

  Want to know where people are drawing, but don't want to pay for a premium subscription? I got you covered!

- **Timelapse recorder**

  Record videos of any canvas with a duration of up to 1 month.
